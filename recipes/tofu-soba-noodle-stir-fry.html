        <li>8 oz Soba Noodles</li>
        <li>10 oz Tofu (firm or extra firm), cubed</li>
        <li>1 handful Broccoli Florets</li>

        <li>2 Scallions, thinly sliced</li>

        <li>1 tbsp Toasted Sesame Oil, for sauteing</li>
        <li>(Optional) Sesame Seeds, for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>For the Marinade</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup Tamari (or Soy Sauce)</li>
        <li>2 tbsp Rice Wine Vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tbsp Pure Maple Syrup</li>
        <li>1 tbsp Sesame Oil</li>
        <li>2 Garlic Cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1 tsp Red Pepper Flakes, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Drain the tofu and lay it on its side for a few minutes to let the water drain</li>
        <li>In a medium size shallow dish, whisk together the tamari, rice wine vinegar, maple syrup, sesame oil,
            garlic, ginger, red pepper flakes.</li>
        <li>Cut the tofu into 1/2 inch cubes. Add the tofu to the marinade and let set for 20 minutes, turning at least
            once halfway through. The tofu is meant to be served at room temp straight from the marinade. Feel free to
            warm it up by adding it to the pan while stir frying the veggies.</li>
        <li>While tofu is marinating, make the soba noodles according to package directions. Rinse well under cool
            running water to cool the noodles and stop them continuing to cook.</li>
        <li>Heat sesame oil over medium heat, add the broccoli and carrots, stir fry for 3 minutes.</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Add a large spoon of marinade, basil and mint, cook another 1 â€“ 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Also, you can add the tofu, marinade and noodles to the pan, tossing well, to warm through.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Serve soba noodle in individual dishes topped with veggies and tofu, and top with remaining marinade, scallions, sesame seeds and additional fresh herbs.</li>
    </ol>
