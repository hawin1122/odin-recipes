    <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <li>Cut spinach (or baby bok choy, yu choy sum) into 2 1/2-inch long sections.</li>

            <li>Blanch in boiling water quickly until vegetables are cooked to your liking.</li>
            <li>Transfer vegetables to a bowl of cold water to stop the cooking. Then drain and gently squeeze out some excess water. Set aside</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Cook dried soba noodles according to package instructions. Then rinse under cold water thoroughly to remove sliminess and stickiness. Drain and set aside.</li>
